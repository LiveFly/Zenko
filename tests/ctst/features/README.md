## Features folder

Tests are defined as english sentences under the features/* folder.
Files with type `feature` are written in the `gherkin` format and define a set
of scenarios for one feature, and will use JS scripts to run them dynamically.

For more information, see
[CucumberJS documentation](https://github.com/cucumber/cucumber-js/blob/main/docs).
