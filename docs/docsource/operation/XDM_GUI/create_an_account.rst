Create an Account
=================

Because |product| cannot do anything without at least one account to work with,
the first step in any working deployment it to create an account. To create an
account:

#. Log into the XDM UI.

   .. image:: ../Graphics/xdm_ui_login.png

#. The **CREATE NEW ACCOUNT** window displays.

   .. image:: ../Graphics/xdm_ui_create_account.png

   Enter a unique account name and the email address for the account
   administrator (root). You can also use the **Quota in GB** field to set a
   hard upper limit on space available to this account. This limit can be raised
   after the account is created. If no value is entered, |product| imposes no
   size limit on the account.

   Click **Create**.

#. The **Accounts** view displays with the new account information.

   .. image:: ../Graphics/xdm_ui_account_created.png

   From this view, the account administrator can create, find, and delete,
   accounts, or click the **Locations** tab to manage account locations and the
   buckets they contain.
