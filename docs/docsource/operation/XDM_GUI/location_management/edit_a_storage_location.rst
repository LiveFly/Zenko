   .. tip::

      If there are many accounts, you can use the field marked *Filter by
      Account Name* to reduce the number of visible accounts to a manageable                                            
      level.

   .. tip::

      If there are many locations, you can use the field marked *Filter by
      Location Name* to reduce the number of visible accounts to a manageable                                            
      level.

   Click the Edit icon.

#. The **EDIT STORAGE LOCATION** window displays. You cannot edit the location's
   name or type. Depending on the location type, you can edit access and secret
   keys, the target bucket name, and the features and advanced options that are
   available. See :ref:`Cloud Storage Locations` for details.
