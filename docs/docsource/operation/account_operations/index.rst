Account Operations
==================

Each |product| location can access and control several locations, each with
several accounts, each account containing several buckets, and each bucket
containing many objects. The |product| UI enables the user to create, edit, 
and delete accounts. The |product| UI also enables the user to create and 
delete access keys.

From the account management window, you can:

  .. toctree::
     :maxdepth: 1

     create_an_account
     delete_an_account
     create_access_keys
     delete_access_keys
