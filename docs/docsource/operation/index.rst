|product| Operation
===================

This site provides guidance on the operation and design principles of |product|,
offers use case-based instruction on how to operate |product| using its GUI,
command set, and API, and describes facilities for monitoring it using
dashboards integrated through Scality's default Kubernetes distribution,
MetalK8s.

For each use case, there is a programmatic interface via an API or an AWS-like
command. A graphical user interface, the |product| UI, supports most
operations. |product| UI is an application-based frontend for the |product|
platform, providing ease of use and excellent opportunities for visualizing
managed data.
