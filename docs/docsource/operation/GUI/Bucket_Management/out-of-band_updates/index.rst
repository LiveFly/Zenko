Out-of-Band Updates
===================

|product| operates by establishing and managing a namespace of data. For select
object stores, |product| does not have to create a namespace; rather, it can read an
existing namespace and use it as its own. This process of metadata ingestion
makes it easier to manage existing data stores, as |product| can "go back in time"
and pick up the history of a namespace and assume management and replication
tasks retroactively.

Out-of-band updates can be performed on S3 Connector, AWS, and NFS servers.
