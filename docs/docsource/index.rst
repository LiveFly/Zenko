About |product|
===============

|product| is Scality's multi-cloud storage controller. It provides a single point of
integration using the Amazon S3 and Azure Blob Storage cloud storage APIs, and
enables data backup, transfer, and replication across private and public clouds.

Using |product|, you can store to a Scality RING storage device and automatically
back up to one or several public clouds. Alternatively, you can use a public
cloud such as Amazon S3 as primary storage and replicate data stored
there--specific files, file types, or entire buckets--to other supported clouds,
such as Google Cloud Platform (GCP) or Microsoft Azure.

|product| can be accessed and managed through the |product| UI, using API calls,
or from the command line. Where it makes sense, Scality provides APIs to help
customize, automate, and improve interactions with |product|.
