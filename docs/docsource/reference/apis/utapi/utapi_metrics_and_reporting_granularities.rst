UTAPI Metrics and Reporting Granularities
=========================================

|product| can track and report the following utilization metrics through a RESTful
API:

-  Storage capacity in bytes
-  Number of objects
-  Network utilization per unit time

   -  Bytes transferred ingoing
   -  Bytes transferred outgoing

-  Number of operations per unit time

   -  PUT operations
   -  GET/LIST operations
   -  DELETE operations
   -  HEAD operations
   -  MPU operations

UTAPI tracks all of these metrics and makes them available for reporting
at the bucket level.

This service is deployed and accessed through a RESTful API that is
securely authenticated via HTTPS, on a dedicated web server and port.
The service is integrated with the |product| IAM policies for access control
through the ``utapi:ListMetrics`` policy action.

To enable access, an IAM policy must first be created that grants
permission for the action, after which the policy must be set to the |product| IAM
Users or IAM Groups that are permitted to access the service metrics.

.. note::

  For efficiency, a global maximum of 100 entities are enforced per call
  for the bucket entities.

Federation currently starts the Utapi server at S3 port + 100 on the S3
container.

.. code::

   env_s3_port | default(8000)) + 100
