.. _Copy Object:

Copy Object
===========

Creates a copy of an object stored by |product|.

.. note::

   To copy an object greater than 5 GB, use the :ref:`Upload Part - Copy` API.

All copy requests must be authenticated. Additionally, you must have read access
to the source object and write access to the destination bucket. Both the region
you want to copy the object from and the region you want to copy the object to
must be enabled for your account.

A copy request might return an error when |product| receives the copy request
or while |product| is copying the files. If the error occurs before the copy
operation starts, you receive a standard S3 error. If the error occurs
during the copy operation, the error response is embedded in the ``200 OK``
response. This means that a ``200 OK`` response can contain either a success or
an error. Design your application to parse the contents of the response and
handle it appropriately.

If the copy is successful, you receive a response with information about the
copied object.

Metadata
--------

When copying an object, you can preserve all metadata (default) or specify new
metadata. However, the ACL is not preserved and is set to private for the user
making the request. To override the default ACL setting, specify a new ACL when
generating a copy request. For more information, see `Managing Access with ACLs`_.

To specify whether to copy the object metadata from the source object or to
replace it with metadata provided in the request, add the
x-amz-metadata-directive header. Grant permissions using the
s3:x-amz-metadata-directive condition key to enforce metadata behaviors when
objects are uploaded. For more information, see `Amazon S3 Condition Keys`_. For
a complete list of Amazon S3-specific condition keys, see Actions, Resources,
and Condition Keys for Amazon S3.

x-amz-copy-source-if Headers
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To copy an object only under certain conditions, such as when the Etag matches
or the object was modified before or after a specified date, use the
following request parameters:

* ``x-amz-copy-source-if-match``

* ``x-amz-copy-source-if-none-match``

* ``x-amz-copy-source-if-unmodified-since``

* ``x-amz-copy-source-if-modified-since``

If both the ``x-amz-copy-source-if-match`` and
``x-amz-copy-source-if-unmodified-since`` headers are present in the request and
evaluate as follows, |product| returns ``200 OK`` and copies the data:

* ``x-amz-copy-source-if-match`` condition evaluates to ``true``.

* ``x-amz-copy-source-if-unmodified-since`` condition evaluates to ``false``.

If both the ``x-amz-copy-source-if-none-match`` and
``x-amz-copy-source-if-modified-since`` headers are present in the request and
evaluate as follows, |product| returns the ``412 Precondition Failed`` response
code:

* ``x-amz-copy-source-if-none-match`` condition evaluates to ``false``.

* ``x-amz-copy-source-if-modified-since`` condition evaluates to ``true``.

.. note::

   All headers with the ``x-amz-`` prefix, including ``x-amz-copy-source``, must
   be signed.

Encryption
----------

The source object being copied can be encrypted or unencrypted. It can be
encrypted on the server side using Scality-managed encryption keys
(SSE-S3). With server-side encryption, |product| encrypts the data as it
writes it to disk and decrypts the data when you access it. Server-side
encryption can also be requested for the target object, regardless of whether the
source object was encrypted.

ACL-Specific Request Headers
----------------------------

When copying an object, you can grant ACL-based permissions using headers. By
default, all objects are private. Only the owner has full access control. When
adding a new object, you can grant permissions to individual |product|  
accounts or to predefined groups defined by S3. These permissions are added
to the ACL on the object. For more, see `Access Control List (ACL) Overview`_
and `Managing ACLs Using the REST API`_.

Storage Class Options
---------------------

You cannot use the CopyObject operation to change the storage class. S3
Connector does not implement or recognize storage classes. It accepts the
STANDARD class if the client sets it, but it maps to no storage class.

Versioning
----------

By default, ``x-amz-copy-source`` identifies the current version of an object to
copy. If the current version is a delete marker, |product| behaves as if the
object were deleted. To copy a different version, use the versionId subresource.

If you enable versioning on the target bucket, |product| generates a unique
version ID for the object being copied. This version ID is different from the
source object's version ID. |product| returns the copied object's version ID
in the x-amz-version-id response header.

If you do not enable versioning or suspend it on the target bucket, |product|  
generates a null version ID.

The following operations are related to CopyObject:

* :ref:`Put Object`
* :ref:`Get Object`

For more, see `Copying Objects`_.
