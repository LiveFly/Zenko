upload-part
===========

Uploads a part in a multipart upload.

 .. note::

    After you initiate multipart upload and upload one or more parts, you must
    either complete or abort multipart upload. |product| only frees up parts
    storage after you either complete or abort multipart upload.

Synopsis
--------

::

  upload-part
    [--body <value>]
    --bucket <value>
    [--content-length <value>]
    [--content-md5 <value>]
    --key <value>
    --part-number <value>
    --upload-id <value>
    [--cli-input-json <value>]

Options
-------

``--body`` (blob)

  Object data.

``--bucket`` (string)

  Name of the bucket to which the multipart upload was initiated.

``--content-length`` (long)

  Size of the body in bytes. This parameter is useful when the size of the body
  cannot be determined automatically.

``--content-md5`` (string)

  The base64-encoded 128-bit MD5 digest of the part data. This parameter is
  auto-populated when using the command from the CLI. This parameter is required
  if object lock parameters are specified.

``--key`` (string)

  Object key for which the multipart upload was initiated.

``--part-number`` (integer)

  Part number of part being uploaded. This is a positive integer between 1 and
  10,000.

``--upload-id`` (string)

  Upload ID identifying the multipart upload whose part is being uploaded.

``--cli-input-json`` (string)

  .. include:: ../../../include/cli-input-json.txt

Examples
--------

The following command uploads the first part in a multipart upload initiated
with the ``create-multipart-upload`` command::

  $ aws s3api upload-part --bucket my-bucket --key 'multipart/01' --part-number 1 --body part01 --upload-id  "dfRtDYU0WWCCcH43C3WFbkRONycyCpTJJvxu2i5GYkZljF.Yxwh6XG7WfS2vC4to6HiV6Yjlx.cph0gtNBtJ8P3URCSbB7rjxI5iEwVDmgaXZOGgkk5nVTW16HOQ5l0R"

The ``body`` option takes the name or path of a local file for upload (do not
use the file:// prefix). The minimum part size is 5 MB. Upload ID is returned by
``create-multipart-upload`` and can also be retrieved with
``list-multipart-uploads``. Bucket and key are specified when you create the
multipart upload.

Output::

  {
      "ETag": "\"e868e0f4719e394144ef36531ee6824c\""
  }

Save the ETag value of each part for later. They are required to complete the
multipart upload.

Output
------

ServerSideEncryption -> (string)

  The Server-side encryption algorithm used when storing this object in S3
  (e.g., AES256, aws:kms).

ETag -> (string)

  Entity tag for the uploaded object.

SSECustomerAlgorithm -> (string)

  If server-side encryption with a customer-provided encryption key was
  requested, the response will include this header confirming the encryption
  algorithm used.

SSECustomerKeyMD5 -> (string)

  If server-side encryption with a customer-provided encryption key was
  requested, the response will include this header to provide round trip message
  integrity verification of the customer-provided encryption key.

SSEKMSKeyId -> (string)

  If present, specifies the ID of the AWS Key Management Service (KMS) master
  encryption key that was used for the object.
