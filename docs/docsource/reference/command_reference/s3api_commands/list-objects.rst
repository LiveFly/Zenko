.. _list-objects:

list-objects
============

Returns some or all (up to 1,000) of the objects in a bucket. You can use the
request parameters as selection criteria to return a subset of the objects in a
bucket.

See also: `AWS API Documentation
<https://docs.aws.amazon.com/goto/WebAPI/s3-2006-03-01/ListObjects>`_.

``list-objects`` is a paginated operation. Multiple API calls may be issued in
order to retrieve the entire data set of results. You can disable pagination by
providing the ``--no-paginate`` argument.  When using ``--output text`` and the
``--query`` argument on a paginated response, the ``--query`` argument must
extract data from the results of the following query expressions: ``Contents``,
``CommonPrefixes``.

Synopsis
--------

::

  list-objects
    --bucket <value>
    [--delimiter <value>]
    [--encoding-type <value>]
    [--prefix <value>]
    [--cli-input-json <value>]
    [--starting-token <value>]
    [--page-size <value>]
    [--max-items <value>]

Options
-------

``--bucket`` (string)

``--delimiter`` (string)

  A delimiter is a character you use to group keys.

``--encoding-type`` (string)

  Requests |product| to encode the object keys in the response and specifies the
  encoding method to use. An object key may contain any Unicode character;
  however, XML 1.0 parser cannot parse some characters, such as characters with
  an ASCII value from 0 to 10. For characters that are not supported in XML 1.0,
  you can add this parameter to request |product| to encode the keys in the
  response.

  Possible values:
  
  *   ``url``

``--prefix`` (string)

  Limits the response to keys that begin with the specified prefix.

  Possible values:

  
  *   ``requester``

``--cli-input-json`` (string)

  .. include:: ../../../include/cli-input-json.txt

``--starting-token`` (string)

  A token to specify where to start paginating. This is the ``NextToken`` from a
  previously truncated response.

  |aws_cli_guide|

``--page-size`` (integer)

  The size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does not affect the
  number of items returned in the command's output. Setting a smaller page size
  results in more calls to the AWS service, retrieving fewer items in each
  call. This can help prevent the AWS service calls from timing out.

  |aws_cli_guide|

``--max-items`` (integer)

  The total number of items to return in the command's output. If the total
  number of items available is more than the value specified, a ``NextToken`` is
  provided in the command's output. To resume pagination, provide the
  ``NextToken`` value in the ``starting-token`` argument of a subsequent
  command. **Do not** use the ``NextToken`` response element directly outside of
  the AWS CLI.

Examples
--------

The following example uses the ``list-objects`` command to display the names of
all the objects in the specified bucket::

  $ aws s3api list-objects --bucket text-content --query 'Contents[].{Key: Key, Size: Size}'

The example uses the ``--query`` argument to filter the output of
``list-objects`` down to the key value and size for each object

For more information about objects, see `Working with Amazon S3 Objects`_ in the
*Amazon S3 Developer Guide*.

Output
------

IsTruncated -> (Boolean)

  This flag indicates whether |product| returned all results that satisfied
  the search criteria.

Marker -> (string)
  
NextMarker -> (string)
  
  When response is truncated (the IsTruncated element value in the response is
  true), you can use the key name in this field as marker in the subsequent
  request to get next set of objects. |product| lists objects in alphabetical
  order.

  .. note::

     This element is only returned if the Delimiter request parameter is
     specified. If the response is truncated and does not include the
     NextMarker, use the value of the last Key field in the response as the
     marker in the subsequent request to get the next set of object keys.
 
Contents -> (list)
  
  (structure)
    
    Key -> (string)
      
    LastModified -> (timestamp)
      
    ETag -> (string)
      
    Size -> (integer)
      
    StorageClass -> (string)
      
      The class of storage used to store the object.
      
    Owner -> (structure)
      
      DisplayName -> (string)
        
      ID -> (string)
  
Name -> (string)
  
Prefix -> (string)
  
Delimiter -> (string)
  
MaxKeys -> (integer)
  
CommonPrefixes -> (list)
  
  (structure)
    
    Prefix -> (string)
  
EncodingType -> (string)
  
  Encoding type used by |product| to encode object keys in the response.
