Output
------

QueueConfigurations -> (list)

  The queues to publish messages to and the events for which to publish
  messages.

  (structure)

    Specifies the configuration for publishing messages to a Kafka queue w`hen
    |product| detects specified events.

    Id -> (string)

      An optional unique identifier for configurations in a notification
      configuration. If you don't provide one, Amazon S3 will assign an ID.

    QueueArn -> (string)

      The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the Kafka queue to which |product|
      publishes a message when it detects an event of the specified type.

      .. tip::
          
	 |product| returns QueueARN in conformity with AWS-standard
	 ``arn:partition:service:region:account-id:resource`` format, where:

         ``partition`` is hardcoded as ``scality``.
	 ``service`` is harcoded as ``bucketnotif``.
	 ``region`` is ignored.
         ``account-id`` is ignored.
	 ``resource`` is the name of the destination defined in env/client-template/group_vars/all.

	 Retaining AWS formatting but omitting the region and account-id fields
	 produces a returned queueARN resembling:

	 ::
	    
	    arn:scality:bucketnotif:::destinationResourceName

    Events -> (list)

      (string)

        The bucket event to trigger a notification.

    Filter -> (structure)

      Key -> (structure)

      FilterRules -> (list)

        (structure)

        Specifies the S3 object key name to filter on and whether to
        filter on the suffix or prefix of the key name.

        Name -> (string)

        The object key name prefix or suffix identifying one or more objects to
        which the filtering rule applies. The maximum length is 1,024
        characters. Overlapping prefixes and suffixes are not supported.

        Value -> (string)

        The value that the filter searches for in object key names.
