.. _copy-object:

copy-object
===========

Creates a copy of an object stored in |product|.

.. note::
   
   To copy an object greater than 5 GB, use the Multipart Upload Upload Part-
   Copy API.

All copy requests must be authenticated. Additionally, you must have read access
to the source object and write access to the destination bucket. Your account
must have permissions for both the region from which you want to copy the object
and the region to which you want to copy the object.

A copy request might return an error when |product| receives the copy request
or while |product| is copying the files. If the error occurs before the copy
operation starts, you receive a standard S3 error. If the error occurs during
the copy operation, the error response is embedded in the ``200 OK``
response. This means that a ``200 OK`` response can contain either a success or
an error. Parse and manage the contents of the response appropriately.

If the copy is successful, you receive a response with information about the
copied object.

Metadata
--------

When copying an object, you can preserve all metadata (default) or specify new
metadata. However, the ACL is not preserved and is set to private for the user
making the request. To override the default ACL setting, specify a new ACL when
generating a copy request. See `Managing Access with ACLs`_.


Add the x-amz-metadata-directive header to specify whether you want the object
metadata copied from the source object or replaced with metadata provided in the
request. When granting permissions, you use the s3:x-amz-metadata-directive
condition key to enforce certain metadata behavior on object uploads. 

x-amz-copy-source-if Headers
----------------------------

To copy an object only under certain conditions, such as whether the Etag
matches or whether the object was modified before or after a specified date, use
the following request parameters:

* ``x-amz-copy-source-if-match``
* ``x-amz-copy-source-if-none-match``
* ``x-amz-copy-source-if-unmodified-since``
* ``x-amz-copy-source-if-modified-since``

If both the x-amz-copy-source-if-match and x-amz-copy-source-if-unmodified-since
headers are present in the request and evaluate as follows, |product| returns
``200 OK`` and copies the data:

* ``x-amz-copy-source-if-match`` condition evaluates to true
* ``x-amz-copy-source-if-unmodified-since`` condition evaluates to false

If both the x-amz-copy-source-if-none-match and
x-amz-copy-source-if-modified-since headers are present in the request and
evaluate as follows, |product| returns the ``412 Precondition Failed``
response code:

* ``x-amz-copy-source-if-none-match`` condition evaluates to false
* ``x-amz-copy-source-if-modified-since`` condition evaluates to true

.. note::

   All headers with the x-amz- prefix, including x-amz-copy-source , must be
   signed.

Encryption
----------

The source object being copied can be encrypted or unencrypted. The source
object can be encrypted with server-side encryption using Scality-managed
encryption keys (SSE-S3). With server-side encryption, |product| encrypts
data as it writes it to disk and decrypts the data when you access it.

You can request server-side encryption for the target object regardless of
whether the source object was encrypted.

ACL-Specific Request Headers
----------------------------

When copying an object, you may use headers to grant permissions based on access
control lists (ACLs). By default, all objects are private. Only the owner has
full access control. When adding a new object, you can grant permissions to
individual AWS accounts or to predefined groups defined by |product|. These
permissions are then added to the ACL on the object.

Storage Class Options
---------------------

You can use the CopyObject operation to change the storage class of an object
that is already stored in |product| using the StorageClass parameter.

Versioning
----------
	
By default, x-amz-copy-source identifies the current version of an object to
copy. If the current version is a delete marker, |product| behaves as if the
object were deleted. To copy a different version, use the versionId subresource.

If you enable versioning on the target bucket, |product| generates a unique
version ID for the object being copied. This version ID is different from the
version ID of the source object. |product| returns the version ID of the
copied object in the x-amz-version-id response header in the response.

If you do not enable versioning or suspend it on the target bucket, |product|  
generates a null version ID.

The following operations are related to CopyObject :

* PutObject
* GetObject
